#### **Overview of the School District Analysis**
  - The purpose of this analysis was to determine the top 5 performing schools, and the bottom 5 performing schools based on multiple criteria. The analysis was ran on a school district and evaluated how schools we doing on their math and reading scores. One viewpoint was to see how they were doing per grade, and another was on how they were doing per student capita. This analysis helps the schoolboard determine if they need to invest more money into the schools per student.

#### **Results**
  - #### **How is the District Summary Affected?**

- - - This greatly increased the performance of Thomas High School.

- - **Scores by School Spending**
- - - With the horrible scores from the 9th grade class at Thomas High School removed, this greatly helps the $630-644 bucket that Thomas High School is associated with.

- - **Scores by School Size**
- - - The removal of the scores would also affect this, as their medium sized schools overall performance is improved.

- - **Scores by School Type**
- - - Since Thomas High School is a charter school, removing the 9th grade scores helps put them above district schools in all categories. 

#### **Summary**
  - The four big changes that happened all had a significant impact on the report. It helped Thomas High School look better than they actually are doing, and helps the schools they are most associated with, i.e. schools that spend $630-644 per student, medium sized, and charter schools. Thomas High Schools 9th grade scores should have stayed, as this would help identify a problem. Analysts would easily determine that something was wrong, and able to pinpoint the issue. Thomas High School is not doing well in their 9th grade reading and math devisions, and something needs to be changed there. After this issue has been identified, then a secondary report with the removal of the 9th graders would make more sense.
